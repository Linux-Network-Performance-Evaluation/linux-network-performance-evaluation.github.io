                <h2>Project Objectives</h2>
                <p>The goal of this project is to evaluate the performance of three latest Linux-based Operating System distributions â€“ <strong>Fedora, Ubuntu, and Kali Linux</strong>. These operating systems need to be configured as software routers before running evaluations. Tools such as <strong>D-ITG</strong> and <strong>iPerf</strong> will be used to generate evaluation traffic.</p>
                <h3>Objectives to be achieved include:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Setup a network with four computers: two clients and two servers (servers configured as routers).</li>
                    <li>Use TCP and UDP as transmission protocols:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Evaluate on IPv4</li>
                            <li>Evaluate on IPv6</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Performance evaluation:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Each evaluation should run a minimum of ten times.</li>
                            <li>Evaluate for throughput, delay, jitter, and packet loss.</li>
                            <li>Any evaluation that falls outside the 95% confidence interval needs to be re-run.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Each evaluation will range from 128 to 1536 bytes to assess performance under different conditions.</li>
                    <li>Set up physical machines with Fedora, Ubuntu, and Kali Linux distributions configured as software routers.</li>
                    <li>Conduct performance evaluations for TCP and UDP transmissions on both IPv4 and IPv6 protocols.</li>
                    <li>Follow the Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC) methodology, including requirement analysis, planning, case development, environment setup, execution, and closure.</li>
                </ul>
